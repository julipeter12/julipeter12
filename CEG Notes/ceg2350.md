cd $HOME is the same as cd ~ The dollar sign makes it a variable \
echo It is similar to a print statement \
The mouse inputs triggers a command line \
<mark>notepad.exe</mark> filename will create or edit a file in notepad\
If the man does not work try help \
<mark>whatis</mark> gives a one line description of what a command is\
<mark>history</mark> shows past command but it is finite and only relevant in the shell you opened but in Linux it will keep a finite number of commands from whenever you ran them
<mark>printf</mark> does not include a return line but echo does

 ### ssh, permissions, git

ssh ~ secure shell\
keygen ~ generate key\
-t means type -C means comment ed25519 is encryption \
<mark>cat</mark> will show you the content in a file or files\
-lah the a means all including hidden files that start with . , the h is for human readable, l shows you the metadata of each file\
The first block is the file type (-), the second block is for read, write, or execute for the owner (rwx), the third block is the group owner and they can read or write (rw-), the last block is for others (r--) they can only read 

<mark>sudo</mark> - super user do, gives you admin permission so to override commands\
<mark>usermod</mark> - use it to add users into a group\
deluser, userdel, useradd, adduser just comes down to which one will work better but they have the same functions\
getent - reads from databases, like passwd, shadow\
who - shows who is logged on\
apt - helps installs tools like microsoft store for microsoft \
finger - user info lookup\
Pull would be from gtihub to vs code\
Pysh would be like vs code to github\

### Rep steps for new sandbox
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C “email’ --> Cd .ssh\ --> ls --> Lock is .pub and the private key has no extension --> Copy public key --> Go to github account settings --> git clone url this will clone your ssh repo then it will make a folder/workspace
<mark>git status</mark> can help you get hints sometimes for a new command\
<mark>git add</mark> will add a file you can put the files in a list to add multiple at once\
<mark>git commit</mark>\
shortcut git commit -m “message”\
Commits have to have authorship \
For the first time using git commit, you need to configure your email and you name --> git config -global user.email "email" --> git config -global user.name "name"

<mark>Everytime you log into the instance make sure to run git pull to make sure everything is up to date</mark>

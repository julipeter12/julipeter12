 ### ssh, permissions, git

`ssh` ~ secure shell\
`keygen` ~ generate key\
-t means type -C means comment ed25519 is encryption \
`cat` will show you the content in a file or files\
`-lah` the a means all including hidden files that start with . , the h is for human readable, l shows you the metadata of each file\
The first block is the file type (-), the second block is for read, write, or execute for the owner (rwx), the third block is the group owner and they can read or write (rw-), the last block is for others (r--) they can only read 

`sudo` - super user do, gives you admin permission so to override commands\
`sudo !!` will sudo the previous command 
`usermod` - use it to add users into a group\
<mark>deluser, userdel, useradd, adduser just comes down to which one will work better but they have the same functions</mark>\
`getent` - reads from databases, like passwd, shadow\
`who` - shows who is logged on\
`apt` - helps installs tools like microsoft store for microsoft \
`finger` - user info lookup\
`chmod` will change the permissions of an item
`chgrp` will change group ownership of an item 
`chgrp -R squad .` will change all groups in the second colummn to squad and in `.` subdirectories. \
press `d` to delete whole lines in vim

### Rep steps for new sandbox
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C “email’ --> Cd .ssh\ --> ls --> Lock is .pub and the private key has no extension --> Copy public key --> Go to github account settings --> git clone url this will clone your ssh repo then it will make a folder/workspace \
`git status` can help you get hints sometimes for a new command\
`git add` will add a file you can put the files in a list to add multiple at once\
shortcut git commit -m “message”\
Commits have to have authorship \
Pull would be from gtihub to vs code\
Push would be like vs code to github \
For the first time using git commit, you need to configure your email and you name --> git config -global user.email "email" --> git config -global user.name "name"\
<mark>Everytime you log into the instance make sure to run git pull to make sure everything is up to date</mark>

### Bash
<mark>variable</mark> is a name with a value stored in memory\
ls_colors are extensions and determine why some files are certain colors, it is a setting
PATH is a list of folders, can find PATH using printenv, 
The `./` in front of the file we want to go in so the system does not read it as a command 
`ls ..` shows you the contents of the previous directory for ex if yoou are in /home/ubuntu it would show you the contents of /home/ \
.bash_history is similiar to history and will show the past commands\
$SHLVL shows how deeply nested you current terminal session is\
&& means both sides must be true \
`source` will execute commands from a FILENAME in the current shell 

### Scripting
`toch demo.sh` --> `vim demo.sh` --> cd /home/ubuntu/CEG2350 created script
bash scripts are the same commands you run on the terminal but in a shell\
When scripting avoid cd in a script and do good pathing\
`bash demo.sh` will run the script\
To change the permission `chmod u+x demo.sh` now you can use `./demo.sh` to run it \
`wget` will get you code from a specified url\
To add something to PATH do PATH=$PATH directory you want to add\
`man test` can help with flags\
Functions need to be declared before \

ex:
create () {
    for ((i = 1 ;i <= $1 ; i++)); do 
        if [ -f file$i$2 ]; then
            echo "File already exists" 
        else
            touch file-$i$2
        fi
}
help_func () {
    echo "The wrong arg was $1"
    echo "First arg is number, second is a base name"
    echo "Sample usage: file-creator.sh 55 .txt"
} 

if [ $# -eq 2]; then
    if [ $1 -gt 0 ]; then 
        echo "Heard, I will create $1 files"
    else 
        help_func $1
    fi
    if [ -n $2]; then
        echo "Heard, base name is $2"
    else
        help_func $2
    fi 
else 
    echo "I said only two args, Bye."
    exit
fi 

### File Manipulation
`wc` will retrieve the word count, the first number is lines, second number is number of words, third number is for characters \
`>>` will append to the file and `>` will overwrite \
heredocs are a way to add to a file until a end (`delimiter`) word is given like EOF EOD DONE can be anything \
`grep` is like a search tool \
can install cowsay and fortune to have some fun with piping 

### Regex
https://regexone.com/ \
regex101.com - inputting sample code and uses this to test pattern syntax and see if they work \
`grep` is a search tool \
`-E` is for extended regular expression 

sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl \
exiftool will reaad and write meta info in files, this tool is very powerful and can change the meta info

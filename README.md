## Hi there 👋

My name is Julianna Peterson-Ramos. I am currently pursing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at Wright State University. I am expected to graduate in Spring 2026.

I am an intern with TetraTech for the Water Deparment of Dayton. I will be working on various projects primarily with PLCs. 

## Upcoming Projects ✨

RF Transmission with Encryption
Ten images will be encrypted and transmitted using two RF transceivers that show weaknesses of a system. This project works on a solution that does not involve Bluetooth, Wi-fi, and Cellular.

Graphics for SCADA Interface
Will be creating graphics to represent different PLCs and other functions for the SCADA system. The graphics are simple but help keep trrrack of how the systems is operating and the specifc PLCs.
